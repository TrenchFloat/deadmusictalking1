Art is subjective!



Me: What do you mean?



P: It’s impossible to tell what someone will interpret from art. Everyone sees art in different ways, and has different definitions of what art is. So it’s not worth much time to talk about the ‘meaning’ of a work, since it means something different to everyone. Leave structure and theory to the ‘trained’ people and the scholars, and let the rest of us interpret as we wish!



Me: I’m going to make an analogy, but I want to make sure we agree on one thing; even an awesome painting is only made up of paint on a canvas. What is special about it is the way that the paint is applied, and the meaning of the painting to whoever is looking at it, not the physical matter itself. Right?



P: Okay.



Me: Okay, let’s say 10 people are watching a soccer game on TV. Some things about the game are understood by everyone, like when someone clearly scores a goal; everybody celebrates or pouts without having to talk about it much. That said, there are some events in the game that not everyone agrees on, like when a player commits a questionable foul, or the ball goes out of bounds. Even if the camera shows a close-up shot of the event, the viewers still argue about what really happened. We could say these events are ‘up to interpretation’, and the clear goals are universally accepted, “universal” meaning everyone in the room agrees on it.



P: That doesn’t seem very universal.



Me: Well, if we want to talk about truth being outside of anyone’s head, we have to ask how we know that the truth is there in the first place. Even if you can answer that question, you’re still talking about what you know.Which is still in your head. To talk about anything outside your own mind,ever, you have to believe or assume on some level.



P: But what about the ground I’m standing on? Is that in my head?



Me: How do you know it’s there?



P: I can see it and feel it.



Me: Using your senses? That’s a mental activity.



P: But that puts everything off-limits!



Me: Exactly.Hume, Kant, and Schrödinger wrestled with this stuff, and wrote lots of books about it. When Descartes was looking for something you could say that nobody could ever argue with, the only thing he could come up with was “I think; therefore I am.”



P: This is getting out of hand.



Me: That’s why, in our soccer analogy, “universal” just meant “everybody agrees on it.” It’s just more practical, and it’s where a lot of those philosophers ended up, anyways.



P: Okay, fine, we’ll go with that.



Me: Then there are some aspects of the soccer game that everyone agrees on, and some aspects that people disagree on, right?



P: Right.



Me: Many would say that that’s the only difference between ‘subjective’ and ‘objective’ meaning.



P: I’m still stuck on how the ground that I’m standing on is just in my head. You’re standing on it, I’m standing on it.



Me: I agree, and since we both feel like we’re standing on a “ground”, then for all practical purposes, it’s really there.



P: And if someone walked in the room and said they couldn’t feel the ground, it would stop existing?



Me: Let’s run with it; If that person was numb in his feet, so he couldn’t feel the ground, and was blind, and couldn’t smell the ground, how should he know it’s there?



P: But you and I are still standing on it. It’s still there.



Me: Okay, one last counter-example: I know there’s a ghost in the room. It’s invisible, intangible, doesn’t make a sound, and otherwise unavailable to us through our senses. It also can’t do anything. How could you tell me I’m wrong?



P: I can’t, but it doesn’t really matter if the ghost exists or not… Okay, I’m seeing your point.



Me: Now what do you make of the “ground” that you and I feel (with our senses), but the numb-and-blind person can’t?



P: He’s in such a state that what exists for us doesn’t really matter to him, as long as he can walk around.



Me: Right. We could try and try to convince him that the ground is there, but he’s got better things to do.



P: Okay, but what’s any of this have to do with art?



Me: The idea is that you can look at ‘objectivity’ and ‘universality’ in more than one way.A whole room full of people can agree on the content of a painting - at least, the basic idea. For all practical purposes, that’s objective reality. Another group from another culture can look at the same painting and all completely agree that it’s something else. That’s objective too, if we’re only keeping track of one group at a time. If we ‘zoom out’ and look at the opinions of both groups, now they disagree, and their ideas are subjective. To find something about the painting that the *new* everyone agrees on, you’d have to get even more basic, like saying, “It’s a painting.”



Last analogy (I promise): The word “cat” objectively refers to the animal called “cat”, for everyone who understands English - but not anyone else.



P: I don’t see the point in calling it ‘objective’ if people can still disagree on it.



Me: It’s all we have to work with if we really want to talk about art. The ‘most consistent’ alternative is to wait until everyone in the entire world agrees on something before you call it objective. Again, philosophers and spiritual leaders have been looking for that kind of thing for a long time - good luck.



P: Isn’t that a stretch?



Me: A sort-of middle ground would be to consider everyone’s perspective within a certain culture. That’s what most music theorists do with classical music: in Europe, from 1600-1900, most people going to concerts understood certain chord progressions the same way. So it’s pretty safe to talk about those chord progressions, even though someone who has never heard classical music before wouldn’t understand them in the same way. You can just talk, with the implied understanding that classical music theory only really works on classical music.



At the same time, there are whole worlds of expression that go undiscussed because there are such wide-ranging possibilities. Towards the beginning, you said those personal possibilities aren’t worth taking seriously. But if we take the approach I gave just now, the “subjectivity-objectivity” debate is now a spectrum. “Objective meaning” is looser because even it depends on the collective interpretation of ‘people in the room’, and at the same time “subjective meaning” is each person’s justified opinion derived from the agreed-upon facts. It’s not just made-up stories anymore; It’s worth seriously talking about, because the objective is closely dependent on the subjective, and vice versa. Some even say they are inseparable; but that’s for another time.
